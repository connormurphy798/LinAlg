# LinAlg

A basic linear algebra library. Written to prioritize learning concepts, rather than computational efficiency.

Supports the following:

- Matrices
  - binary operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, (in)equality)
  - elementary row operations (swap, scale, add)
  - Gauss-Jordan elimination, matrix inversion
  - other operations (transposition, submatrix)
- Vectors
  - binary operations (addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication, (in)equality, inner product)
  - normalization
